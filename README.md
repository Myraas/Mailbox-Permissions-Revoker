## Mailbox-Permissions-Revoker

**Description:**

MailboxPermissionsRevoker.ps1 is a PowerShell script for administrators to find and remove mailbox permissions (FullAccess, SendAs, and SendOnBehalf) assigned to a specific user in Exchange Online. The script scans for these permissions throughout the tenant and provides options to remove them selectively or all at once. It can also import permissions from a CSV file if needed.

**Features:**

- Finds and lists all FullAccess, SendAs, and SendOnBehalf permissions assigned to a specific user.
- Provides the option to remove permissions selectively or all at once.
- Allows importing cached permissions from a CSV file for faster operation.

**Caching Permissions:**

To cache mailbox permissions for faster processing, you can run the AdminDroid "GetMailboxPermission.ps1" (version 3.0) script in the same directory as this script. This will generate a CSV file containing the permissions that can be used by MailboxPermissionsRevoker.ps1.

You can find the AdminDroid script here:
